    aboutme : `Hello !! My name is Aman Tiwari. I'm a full stack web developer
    who is passionate about various web technologies. I like to
    experiment with different web technologies. I have an experience
    of nearly 3 months working with MERN stack and Gatsbyjs. Building
    fancy UI's just like this one that your seeing ðŸ˜… and writing
    blogs about tech stacks is what Aman loves to do. Check my blog
    which I update every week for some Javascript and some cool notes
    on web technologies.
    Currently I work mostly with Javascript technologies like ReactJS
    and GatsbyJS. I also have hands on experience working with cloud
    infrastructures like AWS/GCP and have deployed applications
    keeping scalability in mind. Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Github
    Actions are some of the cool tools I use for CI/ CD. I'm always a
    learner and a self taught programmer.`
